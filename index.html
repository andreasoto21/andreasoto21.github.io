<br/><br/><p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>I like the beach, hiking, traveling, and am obsessed with grizzly bears. I'm thinking of majoring in marketing and minoring in MIS here at UT. When I graduate I want to go to graduate school in Seattle and then visit every continent in the world (minus Antarctica bc ew) and explore the culture in their countries.  </p>
